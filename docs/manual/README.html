<pre style="color:white;">
	
After installing all the necessary components, I am 
pleased to anonymize your computer. To use Tor in a 
standard circuit, you should first shut down all 
interfaces and change the MAC address of each interface. 
"shi3lD2" helps you fulfill the mission. Be part of an 
anonymous network and maybe have access to a circuit 
most people need the Tor Bundle. Use your daily applications 
and trust the Snort Port Scanner and the ScanOnAccess Function 
of ClamAV. The Tor Network is like a game in the nineties. 
If you can remember, somewhere in these movies, an 
intercontinental connection, from one server to another 
intercontinental connection and so on, over a dozen servers 
to reach the end node and from there Make the request to the 
TLD. This implies DNS requests, TCP / IP and UDP must be 
redirected. In other words, you can have such a Linux or 
Mac Installation on your computer, with a special volatile 
account, eg Surf through the gate. Then you 
can log in again Your normal computer account.

To read anonymous Mails you need 2 free Web 
Mail Accounts both from a different server, like 
gmx and yahoo. Accomplish this with "Cont-Sec".

Log in to your volatile account in your Computer, 
(no USB - Stick), and download one half of the encrypted 
message from one free web-mail Spam-box, and the other 
part from the other free web-mail Spam-box. "Cont-Sec" 
uses "shi3lD2" to change MAC's bevor starting download. 
After the download of both spam-messages 
"shi3lD2" will shutt down all interfaces.

"Cont-Sec" must have access in to your both 
Spam-boxes, to have a look in all your Spam 
messages, and do a list of all pictures. Do a 
"picture-match-key" with your "Cont-Sec-mobile-app", 
to have the recipient's availability of HTML, 
CSS and Java code, to construct, the encrypted 
message, you must have some Spam in your both 
boxes, more Spam , better acquisition of lost 
code, to construct every days alphabet. The 
encrypted message builds the roman-alphabet, 
from arrays, taken from email-code that matches 
your “picture-match-key”. Each array 
represents a encrypted letter or number. After 
typing the message, "Cont-Sec" applies to 
md5 encryption for each letter and number corresponding 
to the "E-Mail-Code-Fragments" that 
matches the "picture-match-key" with your buddie. You 
need first a "picture-match-key" with 
a buddy, to create a time window in a near or in a far future.

After that, "Cont-Sec" will begin the decryption of the message. 
The "Cont-Sec" GUI, shows you at first the "Reader". The first 
key goes in to the "Reader" and the second key goes in to 
the "Glasses". The "Glasses" are transparent and appears 
after decryption, over the "Reader". The "Reader" de-crypts 
one half of the Message, wich have spaces all over the Text, 
and the "Glasses" complement the spaces over the "Reader", 
decrypting the rest of the message. After Reading you can 
take note in a toillete paper. After changing all MAC's, 
"shi3lD2" loads the new routing table, wich redirects all 
traffic over a Tor Port, like :9001, start's up the 
network trough the new route in to 
your favourite Tor-circuit, and done!
