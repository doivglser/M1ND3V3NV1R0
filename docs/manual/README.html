in to your pocket. Because the account is volatile.

<pre style="color:white;">

 After installing all the necessary components, I would be happy to anonymize your
 computer. To use Tor in a standard circuit, you must first close all interfaces 
 and change the MAC address of each interface. "shi3lD2" helps you accomplish the 
 mission. Be part of an anonymous network with access to any TOR circuit. Most 
 people do not need the Tor Bundle. Use your daily applications and trust Snort 
 Port Scanner and ScanOn Access from ClamAV. The Tor network is like a game in 
 the nineties. If you can remember, somewhere in those movies, an intercontinental 
 connection, from one server to another intercontinental connection, etc., after 
 more than a dozen servers, to reach the final node and from there, make the request 
 to the TLD . This involves DNS, TCP / IP and UDP requests, which must be redirected. 
 In other words, you can have a Linux or Mac installation on your computer. 
 In Debian GNU / Linux 9, using the package manager, apt-get, you can install 
 all the necessary applications, only "Cont-Sec" will be missing.

 To read anonymous emails, you need 2 free webmail accounts, both from a 
 different server, such as gmx and yahoo, or others. Do this with "Cont-Sec".

 Log in to your volatile account on your computer, and download half of the encrypted 
 message from one free email inbox and the other part of the free email inbox. "Cont-Sec" 
 uses "shi3lD2" to change the MACs before starting the download. After the download in 
 both mailboxes of spam messages, "shi3lD2" will close all interfaces. "Cont-Sec" 
 downloads spam messages, apparently randomly. To be able to download any unwanted 
 email, you have to use the "Cont-Sec-mobile-app" to make an "image matching key", 
 using a smart phone, to compare via Bluetooth, the availability of HTML, CSS and 
 Java code. I explain: The code of the unwanted messages, which is used to encrypt 
 the message. Well, you must have some spam in your two spam boxes, more spam, better 
 acquisition of the lost code, to build the alphabet every day. The encrypted message 
 creates the Roman alphabet, from matrices, taken from the email code that matches its 
 "image matching key". Each matrix represents a letter or number. After writing the 
 message, "Cont-Sec" applies an md5 cipher for each letter and number corresponding 
 to the "Email Code Snippets" that match Your "image matching key", made in consultation 
 with a friend. First you need an "image matching key" with a friend, to create a time 
 window in the near future or in the distant future.

 After that, "Cont-Sec" will begin to decipher the message. The GUI "Cont-Sec", shows 
 you at the beginning the "Reader". The first password goes to the "Reader" and the 
 second password goes to the "Glasses". The "Glasses" are transparent and appear after 
 the decryption, on the "Reader". The "Reader" deciphers one half of the message, which 
 has spaces in the whole text, and the "Glasses" complement the spaces on the "Reader", 
 deciphering the rest of the message. After reading, you can take notes on toillette 
 paper. "shi3lD2" will change the MACs of your device and load the new routing table, 
 which redirects all the traffic on a Tor port, like: 9001, will start the network 
 through the new route in your favorite Tor circuit, and that's it!
