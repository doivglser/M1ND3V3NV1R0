# M1ND3V3NV1R0

:::  Deployment environment for Debian 9 GNU/Linux Stretch, in a minimal desktop with antivirus and NIDS. 

- For Debian GNU/Linux.

- Antivirus engine ClamAV and NIDS solution Snort.

- Checks syntax with "python -m pgb", "perl -wc", "shellcheck -e" and "php -l".

- Changes your MAC, to obtain a new IP, "ctrl+C" quit's and revert the connected interface, to vendor's MAC.

- Web surfing with Firefox-ESR and local/web media experience with VLC.

- PlayOnLinux, to install win32 and win64 MS-Windows applications.

- Restarts apache2, mysqld, sendmail, snort, clamd.

- Search script and MySQL(MariaDB) maintainers script.

- For programmers and administrators.

# PROBLEMS:

* no workaround to install wifi firmware (I have

* shi3lD may not work, if your network is down. $(interface) overwrites it selft

* while installing: while installing snort: debconf asks for interface eth0 no 
  workaround for "eno[0-9]" interfaces. Take a look in to "ip route show" and 
  "sudo dpkg --configure -a" with the name of your interface.

# TODO:

* mysql_cp_db: catch the password from /etc/mysql/debian.cnf (but no password here...) 
  I search for the right MySQL syntax to delete id's.
  
* shi3lD is overwriting var $interface. To change the "user-agent" while changing the MAC - addresses.

* sCRYPtUPdater

  To search for brackets and braces, to split the content of the source code into short code 
  snippets. If the workflow interval in minutes is over, refer to the exit handler, if false, 
  reset workflow interval, if true exit. Scan in ~/ for file suffixes or the header with dd, 
  to determine the working directory. Implement Programmable Completion, to auto-complete the 
  command sequence with the [Tab] key.

* mindevenviro.rules, "iptables" drop rules for /etc/snort/rules/
  
* GUI's

* ncurses

# Coming soon:

  An anonym e-mail solution and a volatile secure account on a RAM-Disk. I want to use phyton, because of some C, 
  C++ libraries. I want to build the GUI in GTK+, because GTK+ is portable.
