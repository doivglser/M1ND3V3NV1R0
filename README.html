# PROBLEMS:

* serv-if-up too hevy load

* shi3lD may not work, if your network is down. $(interface) overwrites it selft

* install:

  while installing snort: debconf asks for interface eth0 no workaround for "eno[0-9]" interfaces
  
  Take a look in to "ip route show" and "sudo dpkg --configure -a" with the name of your interface.

# TODO:

* serv-if-up's loop or something

* shi3lD is not working
  
  Workaround to change the user-agent while changing the MAC - addresses.

* sCRYPtUPdater

  To search for brackets and braces, to split the content of the source code into short code snippets.
  If the workflow interval in minutes is over, refer to the exit handler, if false, reset workflow interval, if true exit.
  Scan in ~/ for file suffixes or the header with dd, to determine the working directory.
  Implement Programmable Completion, to auto-complete the command sequence with the [Tab] key.

* mindevenviro.rules

  iptables drop rules for /etc/snort/rules/

# Coming soon:

  An anonym e-mail solution and a volatile secure account on a RAM-Disk. I want to use phyton, because of some C, 
  C++ libraries. I want to build the GUI in GTK+, because GTK+ is portable.
