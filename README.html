:: Cont-Sec

Secure Container with TOR and Sec-Mail inside. The Container is in a 
RAM-Disk, so you don't suffer a lack of security. Your messages belongs 
on a toilette-paper and your anonymity belongs in to your 
pockets, because the account is volatile.

Run on Debian Stretch and on macOS Sierra.

Secure e-mail solution.

    GUI written in GTK+ and python

DESCRIPTION

After install of all needed components, I'll be glad to 
anonymize your computer. To use Tor in a default circuit, you 
should first shut down all interfaces and change the MAC-address of 
each Interface, Cont-Sec helps you to accomplish the mission. 
To run in an anonymous Network and maybe be a part of a circuit, all 
most people don't need the Tor Bundle. You can use your normal daily 
Applications and thrust the Snort Port Scanner and the ScanOnAccess 
feature from ClamAV. The Tor Network is just like a game of the middle 90'. 
If you can remember, every where in those movies; an intercontinental 
connection from a Server to an other intercontinental connection an so on, 
throughout a dozen others Servers, to reach the end node and from there 
make the request to the TLD. This implies DNS requests, so, TCP/IP and UDP 
must be redirected. In other words, you can have such a Linux or Mac 
installation on your computer, with a special volatile account, for 
surfing through Tor. After that you can just log back to 
your normal computer account.

To read anonymous Mails you need 2 free Web Mail Accounts, both from a 
different server, ie. gmx and yahoo. Accomplish this with "Cont-Sec". 
Log in to your volatile account in your Computer, (no USB - Stick), and download a 
half of the encrypted message from one free web-mail Spam-box, and the other part 
from the other free web-mail Spam-box. "Cont-Sec" uses "shi3lD2.sh" to change MAC's 
bevor downloading and after the download of the encrypted messages. Cont-Sec must 
have access in to your Spam-box to download a message sent by Cont-Sec, from an other 
Cont-Sec-User in to your Spam-boxes. The messages are sent to recipients e-mail addresses 
ie. gmx and yahoo) in to the Spam-box, as spam, containing, one half of the the encrypted-message 
with the encryption key, embed in to the code of the message in the Spam-box, 
and the other half is embed in to the code of the other message in the other Spam-box. After that, 
"shi3lD2.sh" will shut down all interfaces, to begin the decryption. The "Sec-Mail" GUI, shows you 
at first the "Reader". The first half of the key goes in to the "Reader" and the second half of the 
key goes in to the "Glasses". The "Glasses" are transparent and appears after decryption, over the 
"Reader". The "Reader" de crypts one half of the Message, wich have spaces all over the Text, and 
the "Glasses" complement the spaces over the "Reader", decrypting the rest of the message. After 
Reading you can take note in a toillete paper. After changing all MAC's, "shi3lD2.sh" loads the 
new routing table, wich redirects all traffic over a Tor Port, like :9001, starts up the network 
trough the new route in to your favourite Tor-circuit, and done!
