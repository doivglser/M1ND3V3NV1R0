<pre style="color:white;">
Secure Container with TOR and "Cont-Sec" inside. The Container is in a 
RAM-Disk, so you don't suffer a lack of security. Your messages belongs 
on a toilette-paper and your anonymity belongs in to your 
pockets, because the account is volatile.

Run on Debian Stretch and on macOS Sierra.

<h3 style="color:white;">DESCRIPTION</h3>

<pre style="color:white;">
After install of all needed components, I'll be glad to 
anonymize your computer. To use Tor in a default circuit, you 
should first shut down all interfaces and change the MAC-address of 
each Interface. "shi3lD2" helps you to accomplish the mission. 
To run in an anonymous Network and maybe be a part of a circuit, all 
most people need the Tor Bundle. You can use your normal daily 
Applications and thrust the Snort Port Scanner and the ScanOnAccess 
feature from ClamAV. The Tor Network is just like a game of the middle 90'. 
If you can remember, every where in those movies; an intercontinental 
connection from a Server to an other intercontinental connection an so on, 
throughout a dozen Servers, to reach the end node and from there 
make the request to the TLD. This implies DNS requests, so, TCP/IP and UDP 
must be redirected. In other words, you can have such a Linux or Mac 
installation on your computer, with a special volatile account, for 
surfing through Tor. After that you can just log back to 
your normal computer account.

To read anonymous Mails you need 2 free Web Mail Accounts both from a 
different server, like gmx and yahoo. Accomplish this with "Cont-Sec".

Log in to your volatile account in your Computer, (no USB - Stick), 
and download one half of the encrypted message from one free web-mail 
Spam-box, and the other part from the other free web-mail Spam-box. 
"Cont-Sec" uses "shi3lD2" to change MAC's bevor starting download. 
After the download of both spam-messages "shi3lD2" 
will shutt down all interfaces.

"Cont-Sec" must have access in to your Spam-boxes to download the 
messages sent by "Cont-Sec", from an other "Cont-Sec-User" in to 
your Spam-boxes. The messages are sent to recipients e-mail 
addresses like gmx and yahoo, in to the Spam-box, as spam, 
containing each, one half of the the encrypted-message with 
the encryption keys, embed in to the code of the messages.

After that, "Cont-Sec" will begin the decryption of the message. 
The "Cont-Sec" GUI, shows you at first the "Reader". 
The first key goes in to the "Reader" and the second key 
goes in to the "Glasses". The "Glasses" are transparent and 
appears after decryption, over the "Reader". The "Reader" 
de-crypts one half of the Message, wich have spaces all over 
the Text, and the "Glasses" complement the spaces over the 
"Reader", decrypting the rest of the message. After Reading 
you can take note in a toillete paper. After changing all 
MAC's, "shi3lD2" loads the new routing table, wich 
redirects all traffic over a Tor Port, like :9001, 
start's up the network trough the new route 
in to your favourite Tor-circuit, and done!
