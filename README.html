# M1N-D3V-3NV1R0

:::  Deployment environment for Debian 9 GNU/Linux Stretch, in a minimal desktop with antivirus and NIDS. 

° For Debian GNU/Linux.

° Antivirus engine ClamAV and NIDS solution Snort.

° Checks syntax with "python -m pgb", "perl -wc", "bash -xvn" and "php -l".

° Changes your MAC, to obtain a new IP, "ctrl+C" quit's and revert the connected interface, to vendor's MAC.

° Web surfing with Firefox-ESR and local/web media experience with VLC.

° PlayOnLinux, I use Ableton Suite.

° Restarts apache2, mysqld, sendmail, snort, clamd.

° For programmers and administrators.

# PROBLEMS:

* shi3lD.sh may not work, if your network is down.

* install.sh:

  while installing snort: debconf asks for interface eth0 no workaround for "eno[0-9]" interfaces
  
  Take a look in to "ip route show" and "sudo dpkg --configure -a" with the name of your interface.

# TODO:

* shi3lD.sh is not working
  
  Workaround to change the user-agent while changing the MAC - addresses.

* sCRYPtUPdater.sh

  To search for brackets and braces, to split the content of the source code into short code snippets.
  If the workflow interval in minutes is over, refer to the exit handler, if false, reset workflow interval, if true exit.
  Scan in ~/ for file suffixes or the header with dd, to determine the working directory.
  Implement Programmable Completion, to auto-complete the command sequence with the [Tab] key.

* mindevenviro.rules

  iptables drop rules for /etc/snort/rules/
